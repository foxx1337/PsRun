# PsRun - Headless PowerShell Host

Running `powershell.exe script.ps1` always results in showing the console window. This is
true even when running with the various `-WindowStyle` or `-NonInteractive` switches.

This application is a native (similar to the various wscript) powershell host (so no window
unless somethings goes really wrong).
